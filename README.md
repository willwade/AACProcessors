A Python library to read, import, export and modify pagesets from different AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) providers. Currently supports:

- Grid 3 (`.gridset`)
- CoughDrop (`.obf`, `.obz`)
- TouchChat (`.touchChat`)
- Snap Core First (`.spb`)

## Features

- Extract text content from AAC pagesets
- Load AAC pagesets into a common tree structure
- Support for multiple AAC software formats
- Translation support for extracted text
- Consistent API across different AAC formats

## Installation

```bash
pip install aac-processors
```

## Quick Start

```python
from aac_processors import GridsetProcessor, CoughDropProcessor, TouchChatProcessor, SnapProcessor

# Example with Grid 3
processor = GridsetProcessor()
texts = processor.extract_texts("path/to/your.gridset")
print(f"Found {len(texts)} text items")

# Load into tree structure
tree = processor.load_into_tree("path/to/your.gridset")
print(f"Found {len(tree.pages)} pages")

# Translate texts
translations = {
    "Hello": "Hola",
    "Goodbye": "AdiÃ³s"
}
translated_file = processor.process_texts("path/to/your.gridset", translations, "path/to/output.gridset")
```

## Supported Formats

### Grid 3 (`.gridset`)
- Full support for reading grid layouts
- Text extraction from buttons and pages
- Translation support

### CoughDrop (`.obf`, `.obz`)
- Support for both single board (`.obf`) and board set (`.obz`) formats
- Extraction of button labels and messages
- Translation capabilities

### TouchChat (`.touchChat`)
- Support for TouchChat page sets
- Button text extraction
- Page structure loading

### Snap Core First (`.spb`)
- Support for Snap Core First board sets
- Text extraction from buttons and pages
- Basic translation support

## API Documentation

### Base Classes

#### FileProcessor
The base class that all format-specific processors inherit from.

```python
class FileProcessor:
    def extract_texts(self, file_path: str) -> List[str]:
        """Extract all text content from the file"""
        
    def load_into_tree(self, file_path: str) -> AACTree:
        """Load the file into a common tree structure"""
        
    def process_texts(self, file_path: str, translations: Dict[str, str], output_path: str) -> str:
        """Process and translate texts in the file"""
```

### Common Data Structures

#### AACTree
Represents the common structure for all AAC formats.

```python
class AACTree:
    pages: Dict[str, AACPage]  # Dictionary of pages by ID
    root_page: str  # ID of the root page
```

#### AACPage
Represents a single page in an AAC system.

```python
class AACPage:
    id: str
    title: str
    grid_size: Tuple[int, int]
    buttons: Dict[str, AACButton]
```

#### AACButton
Represents a button in an AAC system.

```python
class AACButton:
    id: str
    label: str
    message: str
    position: Tuple[int, int]
    type: ButtonType
```
